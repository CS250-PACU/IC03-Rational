# CS250 Intro to [CSII IC03 - RationalSet]

**CS250 Intro to CSII\
Practice on Sets**

Before you start, from Moodle 1) click on the link to clone the IC03-RationalSet starter repository and 2) download the IC03-RationalSetFiles zip from Moodle that contains RationalSet.cpp, RationalSet.h, and RationalSetDriver.cpp.  As described in lecture, create a new project RationalSet and incorporate these three files into this project, making sure that the two projects are linked correctly.  

TODOs:
1. Create three RationalSet objects: cRatSetOne, cRatSetTwo, and cRatSetIntersection
2. Create four Rational objects: 
* cRationalOne with numerator 1 and denominator 100
* cRationalTwo with numerator 2 and denominator 400
* cRationalThree with numerator 3 and denominator 900
* cRationalFour with an unspecified numerator and denominator
3. Implement the function add in RationalSet
4. Use the add function to add cRationalOne, cRationalTwo, and cRationalThree to the set cRatSetOne
5. Implement the function multiply  in RationalSet
6. Use the multiply function to multiply cRationalOne and cRationalTwo and assign this product to cRationalFour
7. Add cRationalFour to the set cRatSetOne
8. Use the add function to add cRationalTwo, CRationalOne, and cRationalThree to the setcRatSetTwo
9. Use the multiply function to multiply cRationalThree and cRationalOne and assign this to cRationalFour
10. Implement the function print in RationalSet
11. Use the print function to print the set cRatSetOne and cRatSetTwo (delineate these as "SET ONE" and "SET TWO")
12. Implement the function intersection in RationalSet
13. Use the intersection function to find the intersection of cRadSetOne and cRatSetTwo and store that intersection in cRatSetIntersection
14. Print the set cRatSetIntersection (delineate as “INTERSECTION”) 
15. Implement the function isIn in RationalSet
16. Use the isIn function to check if the rational cRationalThree is in the set  cRatSetIntersection and print YES or NO.
