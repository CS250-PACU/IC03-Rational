# CS250 Intro to [CSII IC03 - RationalSet]

**CS250 Intro to CSII\
Practice on Sets**

Before you start, from Moodle 1) click on the link to clone the IC03-RationalSet starter repository and 2) download the IC03-RationalSetFiles zip from Moodle that contains RationalSet.cpp, RationalSet.h, and RationalSetDriver.cpp.  As described in lecture, create a new project RationalSet and incorporate these three files into this project, making sure that the two projects are linked correctly.  

TODOs:
1. Create three RationalSet objects: cRatSetOne, cRatSetTwo, and cRatSetIntersection
2. Create four Rational objects: 
* cRationalOne with numerator 1 and denominator 100
* cRationalTwo with numerator 2 and denominator 400
* cRationalThree with numerator 3 and denominator 900
* cRationalFour with an unspecified numerator and denominator
3. Implement the function add in RationalSet
4. Use the add function to add cRationalOne, cRationalTwo, and cRationalThree to the set cRatSetOne
5. Use the multiply function from the Rational class to multiply cRationalOne and cRationalTwo and assign this product to cRationalFour
6. Add cRationalFour to the set cRatSetOne
7. Use the add function to add cRationalTwo, cRationalThree, and cRationalFour to the set cRatSetTwo
8. Implement the function print in RationalSet (be sure to use the write function from the Rational class!)
9. Use the print function to print the set cRatSetOne and cRatSetTwo (delineate these as "SET ONE" and "SET TWO")
10. Implement the isIn function in RationalSet (be sure to use the equals function from the Rational class!)
11. Use the isIn function to check if the rational cRationalThree is in the set cRatSetIntersection and print YES or NO. 
12. Implement the function intersection in RationalSet
13. Use the intersection function to find the intersection of cRatSetOne and cRatSetTwo and store that intersection in cRatSetIntersection
14. Print the set cRatSetIntersection (delineate as “INTERSECTION”)
